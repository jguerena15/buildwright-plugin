Load the `build-ui` skill and build the UI for the specified design.

If Figma MCP tools are not available, inform the user with a link to the setup guide before proceeding:
https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server

If additional context is provided, use it. Otherwise ask the user what they'd like to build and check Figma for the design.
